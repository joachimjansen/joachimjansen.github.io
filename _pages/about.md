I am a freshwater ecologist who uses data science to study flows of energy and carbon in our inland waters. My work brings together fields of aquatic biogeochemistry, physical limnology and freshwater ecology. I enjoy working on interdisciplinary questions about interactive processes: how does thermal stratification impact the supply of oxygen to deep waters, and in turn aerobic and anaerobic metabolism? Can we combine data and models to predict future greenhouse gas emissions from lakes in different global warming scenarios? To answer these questions, my research applies a variety of methods, including field measurements, statistical analysis of long-term and high-frequency environmental monitoring datasets as well as data-model synthesis.

In 2020 I was awarded an international postdoc fellowship from the Swedish Research Council to study long-term decline of dissolved oxygen in northern lakes. The project is advised by [Prof. Gesa Weyhenmeyer](https://weyhenmeyer.weebly.com/) at Uppsala University, Sweden, and [Prof. Yves Prairie](https://gril.uqam.ca/members/yves-prairie/) and [Prof. Paul del Giorgio](https://gril.uqam.ca/members/paul-del-giorgio/) at the Université du Quebéc à Montréal, Canada. Results from this work were published in the August 2024 issue of [Nature Climate Change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02058-3).

In 2024 I started a postdoc at the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research at the University of Helsinki. My current research program focuses on synthesis of water quality datasets in governmental and institutional databases in order to identify and explain broad-scale, long-term trends. This work includes oxygen and carbon gas dynamics in coastal waters as well as freshwater lakes.
